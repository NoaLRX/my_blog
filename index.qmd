## **What is this blog about ?**

This blog serves as a **resume**/**portfolio**. I will share here all my projects and studies in statistics to show my skills and knowledge. The graphs and analyses I present are made using tools such as **Quarto** and **Shiny**, which allow **interactive and intuitive data visualization.** I believe that these tools add an extra dimension to understanding and interpreting data, and I am happy to use them to present my work in a clear and engaging way. I hope this blog will give you an insight into my skills and experience in statistics and data analysis.
